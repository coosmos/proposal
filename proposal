Proposal for Season of KDE: Improving the GUI of Mankala

Project Title: Improving the GUI of Mankala
Abstract
The Mankala Engine has been recently developed, but its current graphical user interface (GUI) is simple and lacks the polish expected of a modern cross-platform game. This project aims to enhance the visual and interactive experience of the Mankala game by implementing an intuitive, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing GUI using QML. Through this project, I aim to learn and apply advanced QML concepts and improve my design skills to create a beautiful, functional GUI that aligns with KDE’s standards.

Project Goals
Enhanced Visual Appeal: Redesign the game board, tiles, and animations to make them more engaging and visually attractive.
Improved Usability: Ensure the game’s interface is intuitive and responsive, with smooth transitions and user interactions.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Develop a GUI that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
Incorporate Feedback: Collaborate with mentors and the KDE community to refine the design and functionality based on feedback.

Deliverables
Phase 1: Research and Setup


Study the existing Mankala GUI and familiarize myself with its structure and components.
Understand KDE’s Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) for consistency.
Set up a local development environment for the Mankala project.
Phase 2: GUI Prototyping


Design wireframes/mockups for the improved interface.
Collaborate with mentors to finalize the design.
Phase 3: Development


Implement the new GUI in QML, focusing on:
Improved board layout and visuals.
Tile animations (e.g., smooth movement of stones).
Responsive design for different screen sizes.
Add visual feedback for user interactions (e.g., hover effects, clicks).
Phase 4: Testing and Documentation


Test the GUI on various platforms (Linux, Windows, mobile devices) for bugs and performance issues.
Document the design decisions, implementation details, and lessons learned.

Timeline
Weeks 1-2: Research and Design
Study the existing Mankala GUI and familiarize myself with its structure and components.
