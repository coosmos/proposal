### **Project Title**: Improving the GUI of Mankala

### **Abstract**
The Mankala Engine has been recently developed, but its current graphical user interface (GUI) is simple and lacks the polish expected of a modern cross-platform game. This project aims to enhance the visual and interactive experience of the Mankala game by implementing an intuitive, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing GUI using QML. Through this project, I aim to learn and apply advanced QML concepts and improve my design skills to create a beautiful, functional GUI that aligns with KDE’s standards.

### **Project Goals**

1. **Enhanced Visual Appeal**: Redesign the game board, tiles, and animations to make them more engaging and visually attractive.
2. **Improved Usability**: Ensure the game’s interface is intuitive and responsive, with smooth transitions and user interactions.
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Develop a GUI that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
4. **Incorporate Feedback**: Collaborate with mentors and the KDE community to refine the design and functionality based on feedback.

### **Deliverables**

1. **Phase 1: Research and Setup**
   - Study the existing Mankala GUI and familiarize myself with its structure and components.
   - Understand KDE’s Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) for consistency.
   - Set up a local development environment for the Mankala project.

2. **Phase 2: GUI Prototyping**
   - Design wireframes/mockups for the improved interface.
   - Collaborate with mentors to finalize the design.

3. **Phase 3: Development**
   - Implement the new GUI in QML, focusing on:
     - Improved board layout and visuals.
     - Tile animations (e.g., smooth movement of stones).
     - Responsive design for different screen sizes.
   - Add visual feedback for user interactions (e.g., hover effects, clicks).

4. **Phase 4: Testing and Documentation**
   - Test the GUI on various platforms (Linux, Windows, mobile devices) for bugs and performance issues.
   - Document the design decisions, implementation details, and lessons learned.

### **Timeline**

**Weeks 1-2: Research and Design**  
- Set up the Mankala project locally.
- Study KDE’s HIG and evaluate other KDE games for inspiration.
- Design and iterate on mockups for the GUI.

**Weeks 3-4: Basic Layout Implementation**  
- Implement the initial layout in QML.
- Ensure the basic design is functional and matches the mockups.
- Gather feedback from mentors and iterate.

**Weeks 5-6: Visual Enhancements**  
- Add animations for moving tiles and interactive elements.
- Refine the board design and visuals.
- Begin testing for responsiveness across platforms.

**Weeks 7-8: Advanced Features and Finalization**  
- Add visual feedback for user interactions (hover effects, clicks, etc.).
- Optimize performance for mobile devices.
- Conduct thorough testing and fix any bugs.

**Weeks 9-10: Final Testing and Documentation**  
- Perform comprehensive testing on Linux and other platforms.
- Write detailed documentation on the design and implementation process.
- Submit the final project to mentors for review.

### **Why Me?**
I am passionate about contributing to KDE and learning through real-world projects. My experience with KDE (education/gcompris!219) and foundational knowledge of QML and C++ make me a suitable candidate for this project. I am eager to improve my skills and create a polished GUI for Mankala that reflects the quality and usability of KDE’s applications.
