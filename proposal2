Proposal for mancala: Improve the mancala GUI 

Project Abstract 
I propose to enhance the existing GUI of mancala game ,mancala has been recently developed ,and hence
current GUI is simple .My objective is to enhance the visuals and interactive experiance of the mankala
game by implementing and intuitive,user-friendly ,and pleasing GUI using kirigami framework.
Through this project I aim to learn and apply advanced qml concepts and improve my design skills to create 
a beautiful ,functional GUI that also aligns with KDE's standards.

Project proposal
 objectives:
  Familiarization with qt:Gain a comprehensive understanding of the Qt framework. 
          Explore existing Qt documentation to grasp its structure and functionalities.

Enhanced Visual Appeal: Redesign the game board, tiles, and animations to make them more engaging and visually attractive.

Improved Usability: Ensure the game’s interface is intuitive and responsive, with smooth transitions and user interactions.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Utilize Kirigami to ensure the GUI works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

Testing and Debugging:Conduct thorough testing of the converted documentation for accuracy and completeness. Address any issues or bugs that arise during the conversion process.

Deliverables

1. Phase 1: Research and Setup
   - Study the existing Mankala GUI and familiarize myself with its structure and components.
   -Learning and understanding kirigami framework
   - update myself with KDE's human interface guidlines
   - Set up a local development environment for the Mankala project.

2. Phase 2: GUI Prototyping
   - Design wireframes/mockups for the improved interface.
   - Collaborate with mentors to finalize the design.

3. Phase 3: Development
   - Implement the new GUI in QML, focusing on:
     - Improved board layout and visuals.
     - Tile animations (e.g., smooth movement of stones).
     - Responsive design for different screen sizes.
   - Add visual feedback for user interactions (e.g., hover effects, clicks).

4. Phase 4: Testing and Documentation
   - Test the GUI on various platforms (Linux, Windows, mobile devices) for bugs and performance issues.
   - Document the design decisions, implementation details, and lessons learned.


Skills Required:
good  knowledge of cpp
 good understanding of qml concepts.
familiarity with Qt framework.
understanding of kirigami
 Basics of version control using git.

Timeline
 week 1-2: Research and Design
1.set up the mankala project locally 
2.study Kde's hig and research on existning games design and understand qml integeration with  backend logic
  from existing games .
3.Explore Kirigami concepts for cross-platform and responsive designs.
4.Design and iterate on mockups for the gui


week 3-4:
1. Design wireframes and get feedback from the mentors.
2.Implement the design and build a basic layout using qml and kirigami components
3.Ensure the desgin is functional and matches the mockups
4.gather feedback and reiterate.

week 5-6:
1.Advance into adding animations for moving tiles and interactive elements.
2.Refine the board design and Visuals
3.Begin testing for responsiveness across platforms.

week 7-8 Advanced features and Finalization
1.Add visual feedbacks for user interactions.
2.conduct through testing and fix any inconsistencies and bugs.
3.gather feedback from mentors,work on increasing the scope of the project proposal.

week 9-10
1.write detailed documentation on the design and implementation process
2.Submit the final project to mentors for review

Forseen Challenge:-
1.Backend intergeration would be a challenging for me .
2.cross-platform compatibility might be a challenge,I belive extensively testing it on different platforms would help.
3.Debugging and Testing ,performing extensive testing on different platforms and fixing bugs.


References/relevant Background info
I am looking for any opportunity to enhance and upgrade my skills by working on real life projects.I am a cs student and I have been actively participating 
and interacting with kde events. I came across kde last few months back and since then I have been deeply involved into learning and contributing .I have been working on  a similar project 
Gcompris (education/gcompris!219) .I have learned significantly from gcomp codebase ,and enhaced my knowledge over Qml.
